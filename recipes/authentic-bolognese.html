    <h2>This authentic Bolognese Sauce is meat-centric and completely different from the bright red, tomato-based North
        American version of the sauce: it's creamy, aromatic, and surprisingly delicate in flavor.</h2>

    <p> When having a delicious bowl of homemade Bolognese, do you ever wonder if Bolognese in Italy is just as good?
        Well I'm here to tell you it's better. Different, but better (those Italians really know what
        they're doing).</p>

    <p>Allow me to take your taste buds on a journey over to Bologna where this amazing dish was invented. Now, with any
        journey into an unfamilliar place, this will require trust. You might be thinking to yourself "this sauce has
        milk and celery in it?!". Yes, yes it does, and you'll just have to trust me. You will thank me later.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 medium-sized yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 small or 2 large, carrots, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, diced</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>4.5 oz diced pancetta (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt, or fine sea salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 lb lean ground meat (beef, veal, or a combination)</li>
        <li>1 cup crisp, dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk (3.25% m.f.) or partly skimmed milk (2% m.f.)</li>
        <li>1 can (28 oz/794 g) diced tomatoes, or crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large stainless steel pot set over medium heat, add the butter and the oil and stir until the butter is
            melted. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, and half of the salt (½ tsp/2 ml) and sauté for 5 minutes,
            stirring often, until the vegetables are soft. Add the diced pancetta and cook for a further 10 minutes,
            until the pancetta is golden and crisp.</li>

        <li><strong>Add a third of the ground meat,</strong> stirring and breaking lumps with a wooden spoon between
            each addition. Adding the meat gradually allows the excess water and liquid to evaporate, which is key for
            the meat to caramelize properly. Once the meat is cooked, add a third more of the meat, stirring and
            breaking lumps as you go. Repeat with the remaining meat.</li>

        <li>When the meat is cooked and no lumps remain, set a timer to 10 minutes and keep cooking the meat, stirring
            from time to time. You want the meat to caramelize and even become crispy in spots. Golden bits of meat will
            stick to the bottom of the pot, which you will deglaze with white wine later. Watch over the pan at all
            times as you don’t want the meat to burn.</li>

        <li>Add the white wine into the saucepan. With the wooden spoon, scrape all the brown bits stuck to the bottom
            of the pot. Push the meat all around to make sure you scrape it all off. By the time you’re finished, the
            wine will be evaporated (2 to 3 minutes). <strong>Be careful not to let the meat stick to the bottom of the
                pot again</strong>—lower the heat if necessary.</li>

        <li>Half-cover and simmer gently for about 2 hours, setting yourself a timer to give the sauce a stir every 30
            minutes. The sauce is ready when it looks rich and creamy, and the texture is thick like oatmeal. No liquid
            should separate from the sauce when you push the sauce to one side. Taste and adjust the seasoning if
            needed.</li>

        <li>Serve with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and basil</li>
