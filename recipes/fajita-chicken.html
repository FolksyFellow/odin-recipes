        <li>1 yellow bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>10 oz canned diced tomatoes with green chiles, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add half of the sliced peppers and onions to the slow cooker. Place the chicken on top and sprinkle on both
            sides with the taco seasoning. Add the garlic, juice of half the lime, and canned tomatoes, then the
            remaining peppers and onion and juice from the remaining lime half.</li>

        <li>Cook on high for 3-4 hours.</li>

        <li>Remove chicken and cut/shred into slices (chicken cooked longer will tend to shred more, cook to your
            preference).</li>

        <li>Return the sliced chicken to the slow cooker to marinate in the juices for about 10 more minutes on low
            until ready to serve. Drain any excess liquid, if desired.</li>

        <li>Add the fajita chicken to the method you want to serve it (we recommend trying it in a burrito bowl, or
            tacos).</li>

        <li>Add your choice of toppings (cheese, guacomole, sour cream, salsa, corn, etc.)</li>

        <li>Enjoy!</li>
